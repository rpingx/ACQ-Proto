                This page is for explaining some of my thought process behind the app.

                Just writing things down as they come to me so I don't forget them later when it comes presentation

                So there isn't any functional reason to use a router for the app.

                Downside is it looks a bit familiar since a lot of apps use Bootstrap, but CSS isn't really the area that I want to get fancy with.
